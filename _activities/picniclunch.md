Our picnic is a regular event which happens {{page.when}}. We get together straight after church, and eat, chat, and enjoy! Everyone is welcome and we love to invite new people to come and join us for this community lunch.

## Is it for me?

Yes it is! Everyone is welcome. You can come to our [morning family service][ms] which happens immediately beforehand but you don't have to! You can come for the start of the lunch and be very welcomed. We sit at round tables in groups of 4 to 6 people. There are about 5 tables.

## How does it work?

 1. Buy or find some lunch food, like sandwiches, pasties, pizza, or even something fancier
 2. Bring it with you
 3. Find a table to sit at
 4. After we've said a quick prayer of thanks, tuck in and enjoy!

## See you soon!

If you have questions, connect with us on [Facebook][fb] or come along to see us on a Sunday morning.

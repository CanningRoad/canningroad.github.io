## What is it? ##

Alpha is an opportunity to explore life and the Christian faith in a friendly, open and informal environment.

## Who's it for? ##

Any over-18s seeking answers and purpose in life! Sorry, but the kids will need to stay home for this one.

## When and where? ##

During social distancing, we can do Alpha online from the comfort of our own homes. There's a short video and a discussion where you can share your thoughts. There's no pressure, no follow up and no charge!

We are looking to start an online Alpha sometime soon based on demand.

If you're interested, please let us know through our ["explore" form](/explore/) by ticking the 'Alpha' box! Thanks!

We ran the Marriage Course online in May 2020, and are aiming to do it again based on demand - see below!

## What is it?

The Marriage course (from the guys who brought us the Alpha Course) is a 7 week course for those in a long term relationship who want to invest and grow their relationship.

The course is open to any couple, whether you've been together for 5 years or 50. Whether things are "all peachy" or it's a time of struggle. This could be for you.

This time of lockdown has affected us all in different ways, good and bad. But for couples, this is likely the most time you've ever spent together! All of this time cooped up has a way of illuminating what was already there: good habits, bad habits, loves, joys, cracks, and scars. 

Each week will go something like this: It's date night, you've put the kids to bed (if you have them) or banished them to their rooms. You have a meal together just the two of you, then join the live stream. Ste and Helen will say a quick "hello" and give an intro to the session. Then as a couple you'll watch that week's session. There are some pauses for discussion where you'll be asked to discuss the topic with your partner (this is **totally** private to you, not group discussion!). You'll each have your own journal/workbook to work through. Then once the video is done Ste and Helen will wrap up the live stream and leave you to it!

## What's it like? ##

For two hours we are open for free tea and coffee (and maybe a nice herbal tea if you fancy) and friendship. We want to provide a homely place in our community where you can meet with old friends and make some new ones. Linda and Liliana are our wonderful Coffee Morning hosts and they're a real treat to spend time with!

## Who's it for? ##

It's open to all. We especially have a heart for women of all ages, including mums, so we have a space for toddlers and toys.

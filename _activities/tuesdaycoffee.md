Do you struggle to get a quiet moment of peace? Come and join us on a Tuesday for a drink and some calm time.

## What's it like? ##

For two hours we're open for free tea and coffee (and maybe a nice herbal tea if you fancy) and friendship. Our aim is to provide a homely place in our community where you can meet with old friends and make some new ones. Linda and Liliana are your wonderful hosts!

## Who's it for? ##

It's open to everyone. We especially have a heart for older folks, and women of all ages - including mums - so we have a space for tots with some toys.

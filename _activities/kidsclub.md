Hero Academy is an awesome mix of games, music, and fun. The kids learn about our hero, Jesus, and how we can learn to live like him!

* We have 45 minutes of crafts, games, and/or sports. You can choose between the sports room and the quiet room, depending on how you feel. Finishing with a group game for everyone to enjoy!

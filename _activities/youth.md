Renew Youth is where we dig into big questions like "Who am I?", and "How can I live a good life?" by exploring the ancient way of Jesus.

## What do we do?

Club: **6:30pm - 7:45pm**

* ☕ We have hot chocolate and healthy snacks together (at no cost)

* 📕 We explore the Bible and what it means for us
* 🏓🏒🎮⚽ We chill with youth club games and activities

After Hours: **7:45pm - 8pm**

For those that want to dig deeper into the Bible, stay another 15 minutes and look at the bible with us. Everyone gets their own copy to annotate their highlights and questions.

## Why "Renew Youth?"

We want to be change makers in the world. People say "Be the change you want to see in the world". We think it all starts with these words from the Bible:

> Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but **be transformed by the renewing of your mind**. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is — his good, pleasing and perfect will.

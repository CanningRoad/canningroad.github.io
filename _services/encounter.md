Are you curious about faith and spirituality?

We're creating a space where anyone can encounter the God that loves them. 

God wants to be right here with us, turning lives around and healing our deepest hurts.

Encounter is a new kind of meet-up based on the ancient way of Jesus, where you can come as you are, and try new things, in a safe space.

## Here's the plan

 + Coffee, tea, and biscuits start at 4pm
 + Fun and relaxed atmosphere
 + Songs
 + Reading, annotating, and writing on Bible verses with our own thoughts
 + Watching a Jesus video from [The Chosen][tc]
 + A short, interesting explainer on what we've seen and read
 + Q&A and discussions
 
[tc]: https://watch.thechosen.tv/

It'll be about an hour long so we'll finish around 5pm.

## Practical stuff

It's on the {{page.when}}:

 + 14th of September
 + 12th of October
 + 9th of November
 + 14th of December

Everyone is welcome. Kids under 11 need to be accompanied by an adult. Young People of 11-16 just need parental consent. We would love to see you there, no matter who you are.

There's space for families and kids to be present and to take part.

If you have things going on, or need to drop in or out for a phone call or even a smoke - you can do that. Drop in and out as needed. 

## What do I need?

Nothing! Come as you are. Don't wear your sunday best, don't bring a thing - just come and enjoy church together.

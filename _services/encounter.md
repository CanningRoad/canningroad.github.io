Are you curious about faith and spirituality?

We want to create a space where anyone can encounter the God that loves them.

We believe that God wants to be right there, moving among us, turning lives around and healing our deepest hurts.

Encounter is a new kind of Christian spiritual meet-up where you can come as you are, and try new things, in a safe space.

## Here's the plan

 + Fun and relaxed atmosphere
 + Songs
 + Reading, annotating, and writing in Bibles (yes, it's allowed)
 + Watching a Jesus video from [The Chosen][tc]
 + A short, interesting talk
 + A bit of Q&A
 + Discussions
 
[tc]: https://watch.thechosen.tv/

## Practical stuff

It's on the {{page.when}}:

 + 10th of August
 + 14th of September
 + 12th of October

We would love to see you there, no matter who you are.

Everyone is welcome. Kids under 11 need to be accompanied by an adult. Young People of 11-16 just need parental consent.

There is space for families and kids to be present and to take part.

If you have things going in, pop in, pop out again. To take a phone call, smoke, whatever you need. 

## What do I need?

Nothing. Come as you are. Don't wear your sunday best, don't bring a thing - just come and enjoy church.

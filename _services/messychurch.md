Messy Church is a fun way for families with younger kids to get into God's house and have a great time. We have a different theme each time that teaches us something about God and Jesus.

## What's it like?

 * Time for crafts and activities
 * A short bible message specially for the kids
 * A couple of songs
 * Eat dinner together (at no cost)
 
We start in the hall with some supervised crafts, and the kids can try as many or as few as they want to. There is also an area with soft toys for the very little ones.

After a while we go into the main church to listen to a short talk with lots of interactive bits, and we all sing some fun Jesus songs.

When that's done, it's dinner time, and everyone is welcome to stay for a free meal.

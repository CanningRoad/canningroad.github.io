Messy Church is a fun way for families with kids to get into God's house and have a great time. We have a different theme each time that teaches us something about God and Jesus.

## What's it like?

- Crafts and activity stations (45 mins)
- A short bible message specially for the kids
- A couple of high energy action songs
- Eat a snack together (at no cost)

We start in the hall with four or five craft stations, and the kids can try as many or as few as they want to. We usually have a big painting, a big building craft, and a range of handicrafts. There's also a toy area for under 3s.

After 45 mins, we go into the main church to listen to a short talk with lots of interactive bits, and we all sing some fun Jesus songs.

When that's done, everyone is welcome to stay for a free snack that we eat together.

On Tuesday 29th of July, we are opening the church building for quiet reflective prayer from **11am - 3pm**.

As we remember the Southport tragedy, the churches of Southport are holding prayer vigils which are open to all.

You can come and take some time to relect, pray, or be prayed for.

For another church closer to you, please see the flyer below.

A warm welcome awaits you.

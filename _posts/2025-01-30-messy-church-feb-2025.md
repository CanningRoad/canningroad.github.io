Get ready for Messy Church on **Saturday 1st of February, 2-4pm**! This time our theme is the wise and foolish builders ("the wise man built his house upon the rock"!) üè°

We've got some great building-related crafts lined up, a fun talk from Simon our Kids, Youth, and Schools worker, and we'll finish our time together with a free snacky tea including fruit, biscuits, and drinks.üçé

For more information, check out our [Messy Church page](/services/messychurch/).

See you this weekend!

Our next Messy Church is on **Saturday 29th of November**, from 2-4pm, and it's going to be a **Messy Christmas**! ⛄

We're going to get those festive feelings flowing with nativity crafts and snacks... some tidy, some messy, some big and some small 🧶

We've got some great activities lined up, a story/talk from Simon (our Kids, Youth, and Schools worker), and we'll finish our time together with a snacky tea.

As always, **it's completely free**. Why not come and give it a go?

For more information, check out our [Messy Church page](/services/messychurch/).

Get ready for our next Messy Church on **Saturday 5th October, 2-4pm**! We’ll be celebrating the theme of harvest with fun activities and crafts for all ages. As usual, we’ll finish up with a snack time featuring fruit, biscuits, and more.

This time, as it's Harvest time of year, we’ll explore how God provides for us because of His great love. 

For more information, check out our [Messy Church page](/services/messychurch/).

We’d love to see you there!

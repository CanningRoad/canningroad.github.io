Happy New Year! We had a great time over this Christmas and New Year with our Carols by Candlelight service, Christmas service, and of course, wonderful time with family and friends. We hope you did too.

Our [Food bank][fb] page has been updated, and food bank will be open again starting next week, on Monday 9th of January.

There is no Hero Academy or Youth this week, and these also restart next week, on Thursday 12th of January.

Coffee time is on pause for the winter season, and we'll let you know when it's back!

Have a great start to the year, and we'll see you soon.

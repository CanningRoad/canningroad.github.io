On **Saturday 5th of April, 2-4pm**, we are gearing up for Easter with an Easter-y themed Messy Church. 

As much as we love chocolate, we've got something even better to look forward to: our hero, Jesus, has defeated death so that we can be friends with him forever! üíù

We've got some great Easter crafts lined up, a story/talk from Simon our Kids, Youth, and Schools worker, and we'll finish our time together with a free snacky tea including fruit, biscuits, and drinks.

Why not come and give it a go?

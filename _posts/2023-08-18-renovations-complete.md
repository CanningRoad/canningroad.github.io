Did you know we've been renovating?

**Well, it's Ready!**

For the last four months, our main worship space has been undergoing replastering, repainting, and some nice new touches.

Join us at the re-opening celebration on **Sunday 27th of August at 10:30am** for a relaxed church service with familiar songs and a short talk. Stay for tea, coffee, and cake afterwards.

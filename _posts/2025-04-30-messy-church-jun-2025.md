Our next Messy Church is on **Saturday 7th of June**, from 2-4pm.

The theme this season will be Zaccheus, the little guy who decided he had to see Jesus at any cost.

We've got some great crafts lined up, a story/talk from Simon our Kids, Youth, and Schools worker, and we'll finish our time together with a BBQ tea! üçî

As always, **it's completely free**. Why not come and give it a go?

For more information, check out our [Messy Church page](/services/messychurch/).

Despite the wet weather, our planned Neighbourhood BBQ turned into a fantastic Family Fun Day indoors! We had a great turnout, with families enjoying a bouncy castle, face painting, and BBQ food. The church was also open for reflection and prayer, where people enjoyed discovering our bright and open worship space.

I personally got to meet various new people from our neighbourhood and had some great chats. It's always a pleasure to meet new High Park People üòÅ

Simon, our new Pastor for Kids, Youth, and Schools, did a great job organizing this great event. We look forward to more gatherings like this in the future!

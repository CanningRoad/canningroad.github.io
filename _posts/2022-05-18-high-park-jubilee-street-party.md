On **Saturday 4th June** from **2-4pm** we're hosting a street party (really a car park party) for all of High Park, to celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee ðŸ‘‘

Let's eat, drink, meet our neighbours, play games, and celebrate!

We're doing this with help from the [High Park Project][hpp] and lots of local people. You can help too (check 'How to Help' below)

## What to Expect

ðŸ¥ª **Please bring some food to share if you can**. We'll have a big buffet table for everyone to put what they've brought for sharing. You could bring anything from sandwiches to sausage rolls to cakes!

We'll have plenty of cold drinks, as well as traditional summer games to play like hoopla, colouring and other activities for the kids.
 
It's a casual event, and you can come and go anytime. Under 16s need to be accompanied by an adult.

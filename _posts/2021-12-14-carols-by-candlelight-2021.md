We are celebrating the Christmas season with our annual Carols by Candlelight service, which will be on **Sunday 19th December at 6pm.** We'd love to see you there for 12 carols and 12 readings that tell the Christmas story. It's a beautiful, peaceful service and a great way to ring in Christmas.

See you then! ðŸŽ„
